# Cluster
Final project for the OS course.
It provides scalable distributed computation of integral with network connection. Host and client provides reliable network system for communication.
- Host - computation node. If node will provide CPU time for other network, host code should be run on it.
- Client - main node. It gives tasks for all hosts and controls computations.
